Prototype implementation of a model interpreter for generating and rendering conceptual models in a conversational user interface. The prototype supports code generation with GPT-4 and Llama 2 and the rendering of <a href="https://plantuml.com/">PlantUML</a> and <a href="https://graphs.grevian.org/">Graphviz</a> code using <a href="https://plantweb.readthedocs.io/">Plantweb</a>. The implementation is based on Python 3.11 with the <a href="https://streamlit.io/">Streamlit</a> framework.
